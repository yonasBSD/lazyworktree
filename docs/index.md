  <p>Easy Git worktree management for the terminal. LazyWorktree helps you create isolated development environments, keep context per branch, and move quickly across parallel tasks.</p>

- **[Quickstart](getting-started.md)** — Get running in minutes and jump directly to selected worktrees from your shell.
- **[Installation](installation.md)** — Install with Homebrew, Arch Linux AUR, or from source.

## Key Features

### Worktree Management

- Create, rename, remove, absorb, and prune worktrees.
- Switch quickly without branch checkout churn.
- Keep each task isolated with its own filesystem context.

### Development Workflow

- Stage, unstage, commit, and inspect diffs in-terminal.
- View CI checks and logs from GitHub/GitLab workflows.
- Open PR/MR links and worktree-aware tooling from the same view.
- Run commands inside OCI containers (Docker/Podman) with automatic worktree mounting.

### Customisation

- Configure globally, per repository, or via CLI overrides.
- Add custom command bindings for shell/tmux/zellij actions.
- Run `.wt` initialisation and termination workflows with trust controls.

## What are Git Worktrees?

Git worktrees allow multiple checkouts of the same repository simultaneously.
This is useful when you need to:

- Work on several branches in parallel.
- Review PR/MR changes without stashing local work.
- Keep long-running features isolated from urgent fixes.

## Why LazyWorktree?

- Keyboard-first terminal UX.
- PR/MR and CI-aware status surface.
- Built-in notes and taskboard per worktree.
- Strong scripting and multiplexer integration.
- OCI container execution for isolated, reproducible builds.
