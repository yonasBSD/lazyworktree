# Notes and Taskboard

Worktree notes keep implementation context close to the worktree itself.
Taskboard extracts markdown checkboxes into a grouped actionable view.

## Notes Behaviour

Press `i` on a selected worktree:

- if a note exists: opens note viewer first
- if no note exists: opens note editor

Viewer controls include scrolling, half-page navigation, and quick edit entry.
Editor supports save, external editor handoff, newline insertion, and cancel.

### Description

Use the command palette (`:`  or `Ctrl+P`) and select **Set worktree description** to assign a short human-readable label to a worktree. When set, the description replaces the directory name in the worktree list for display purposes. This is particularly useful for long directory names such as `pr-2423-feat-implement-graphql-batch-fetching`. Setting an empty description clears it and restores the directory name. The description is also included in filter and search matching, and is stored as part of the worktree note metadata (JSON or frontmatter).

### Tags

Use the command palette (`:` or `Ctrl+P`) and select **Set worktree tags** to assign labels to a worktree, separating multiple tags with commas (e.g. `bug,frontend,urgent`). Tags display as coloured badges (using guillemet brackets, «tag») immediately after the worktree name, with each tag receiving a deterministic colour from the theme palette. Setting an empty value clears all tags. Use **Browse worktree tags** in the command palette to see all existing labels with counts and apply an exact `tag:<name>` filter without remembering the tag text first. Tags are stored alongside other worktree note metadata (JSON or frontmatter) and are included in filter and search matching, making it straightforward to locate worktrees by label.

When a note exists for a worktree, a note marker appears in the worktree list and the Notes pane (pane 5) becomes visible.

</div>

## Markdown Rendering

The info pane renders common markdown elements, including:

- headings (styled hierarchically)
- ordered and unordered lists
- quotes
- inline code and fenced code blocks (syntax highlighted with delta)
- links (highlighted)

Uppercase tags like `TODO`, `FIXME`, and `WARNING:` are highlighted (outside fenced code blocks).

## Taskboard

Press `T` to open Taskboard. It sources markdown checkboxes from worktree notes and presents them in a grouped, actionable view.

### Taskboard Keybindings

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `j` / `k` | Move between tasks |
| `Enter` or `Space` | Toggle task completion |
| `a` | Add a new task |
| `f` | Filter tasks |
| `q` / `Esc` | Close Taskboard |

Example checkbox syntax in notes:

```markdown
- [ ] draft release notes
- [x] update changelog
```

## Automatically Generated Notes

You can prefill notes for PR/issue-based worktrees using `worktree_note_script`. When creating a worktree from a PR or issue, the script receives the title and description on stdin and outputs a note to stdout.

```yaml
worktree_note_script: "aichat -m gemini:gemini-2.5-flash-lite 'Summarise this ticket into practical implementation notes.'"
```

If the script fails or outputs nothing, worktree creation continues normally without saving a note.

For full script configuration and environment variables, see [AI Integration](../guides/ai-integration.md).

## Synchronisable Notes

By default, notes are stored in git config (local to each repository clone). To share notes across machines or with team members, configure a JSON storage path:

```yaml
worktree_notes_path: ".lazyworktree/notes.json"
```

This creates a single JSON file in your repository with all worktree notes. Commit the file to share notes with your team.

!!! tip
    When `worktree_notes_path` is set, keys are stored relative to `worktree_dir` instead of absolute paths, making them portable across different systems.

Alternatively, use `worktree_note_type: splitted` to store each note as an individual markdown file. See [worktree notes](../worktree-notes.md#splitted-mode) for details.
