# Command Palette

The command palette is the fastest way to trigger actions without remembering every key.

## Opening and Filtering

- Open with `Ctrl+p` or `:`.
- Type to filter actions and custom commands in real time.
- MRU (Most Recently Used) ordering prioritises recently used entries at the top.

## Built-in Workflows

The palette surfaces all available actions, including:

- **Worktree actions** — create, delete, rename, set icon, set colour, absorb, prune, sync
- **Commit flow** — search for **Open commit screen** to open the staged commit modal from the palette
- **Git operations** — lazygit, cherry-pick, diff viewing
- **Navigation and pane controls** — focus pane, toggle zoom, switch layout
- **Settings** — theme selection with live preview

The letter on the right of each entry indicates its keybinding (if any) for
quick reference.

For icon picker usage guidance and examples, see [Worktree Operations](worktree-operations.md#custom-worktree-icons).

## Custom Command Integration

Custom commands defined in your `config.yaml` appear at the top of the palette for quick access. Each custom command shows its description and assigned keybinding when one exists.

If a custom command key starts with `_`, it is palette-only: it appears in the palette, but it is not bound to a direct TUI shortcut or shown in footer key hints.

Session-oriented custom commands (tmux/zellij) also expose active sessions in the palette, letting you switch between sessions or create new ones.

For full command schema, see [Custom Commands Reference](../custom-commands.md).

## Suggested Configuration

In `config.yaml`:

```yaml
palette_mru: true
palette_mru_limit: 5
```

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `palette_mru` | `true` | Enable MRU sorting in the palette |
| `palette_mru_limit` | `5` | Number of recent items to prioritise |
