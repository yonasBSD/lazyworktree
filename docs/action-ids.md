# Action IDs Reference

Use these IDs in the `keybindings:` section of your configuration file to bind any key to a built-in palette action. Keybindings use a pane-scoped structure where `universal` bindings apply everywhere and pane-specific sections override them when that pane is focused.

**Valid pane scope names:** `universal`, `worktrees`, `info`, `status`, `log`, `notes`, `agent_sessions`

```yaml
keybindings:
  universal:
    G: git-lazygit
    ctrl+d: worktree-delete
    F: git-fetch
  worktrees:
    x: worktree-delete
  log:
    d: git-diff
```

Keys defined in `keybindings:` take priority over `custom_commands` and built-in keys. The bound key is also displayed as the shortcut in the command palette. Pane-specific bindings override universal ones for the same key.
