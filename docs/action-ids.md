# Action IDs Reference

Use these IDs in the `keybindings:` section of your configuration file to bind any key to a built-in palette action. Keybindings use a pane-scoped structure where `universal` bindings apply everywhere and pane-specific sections (e.g. `worktrees`, `status`) override them when that pane is focused.

```yaml
keybindings:
  universal:
    G: lazygit
    ctrl+d: delete
    F: fetch
```

Keys defined in `keybindings:` take priority over `custom_commands` and built-in keys. The bound key is also displayed as the shortcut in the command palette. Pane-specific bindings override universal ones for the same key.
