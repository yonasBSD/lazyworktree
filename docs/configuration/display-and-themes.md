# Display and Themes

Use these settings to control appearance, icon rendering, and layout behaviour.

## Theme Selection

- `theme`: explicit theme name
- empty `theme`: auto-detect based on terminal background
- CLI override: `lazyworktree --theme <name>`

Built-in themes and details:

- [Themes](../themes.md)

## Layout and Pane Arrangement

- `layout`: `default` or `top`
- runtime toggle: `L`

Layout controls how worktree, status, git status, commit, and notes panes are arranged.

### Custom Pane Sizes

Use `layout_sizes` to adjust how much screen space each pane receives.
Values are relative weights (1–100) that get normalised at computation time,
so `info: 30, git_status: 30, commit: 30` means each gets one-third of the
secondary area.

```yaml
layout_sizes:
  worktrees: 45    # Main pane width (default) or height (top layout)
  info: 30         # Info pane share of secondary area
  git_status: 30   # Git status pane share (when visible)
  commit: 30       # Commit log pane share
  notes: 30        # Notes pane share (when visible)
```

All fields are optional — omitted fields keep their built-in defaults. Focus-based
dynamic resizing still applies on top of the configured baseline.

**Tip:** On smaller terminals, setting `worktrees` to a higher value such as `80`
gives the worktree list more room whilst keeping the info and commit panes visible.
You can also resize the worktree pane at runtime with `h` (shrink) and `l` (grow).

*Worktree pane with `worktrees: 80` — more space for the list on a compact screen.*

## Icon Rendering

- `icon_set`: `nerd-font-v3` or `text`

If glyphs render incorrectly, use `text` or install a patched Nerd Font.

## Name Truncation

- `max_name_length`: max display width for worktree names
- set to `0` to disable truncation
